$survivalstan
========

$survivalstan is a library of Survival Models implemented in `Stan <http://mc-stan.org>` 
with accompanying functions to make Bayesian survival modeling easier.

Typical workflow:

    # import survivalstan
    import survivalstan

    # .. prep your data
    
    # fit your model 
    fit1 = survivalstan.fit_stan_survival_model(...)
    
    # inspect output
    survivalstan.utils.plot_stan_summary([fit1], metric='Rhat') 
    survivalstan.utils.plot_coefs([fit1])

Features
--------

- Variety of standard survival models
    - Weibull, Exponential, and Gamma parameterization
    - A variety of semi-parametric and non-parametric baseline hazards
    - Supports time-varying-coefficients
    - Estimate time-varying effects
    - Varying-effects by group
- Extensible framework - bring your own Stan code, or edit the models provided
- Uses `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>` data frames & `patsy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/patsy>` formulas
- Graphical posterior predictive checking (currently PEM models only)
- Plot posterior estimates of key parameters using `seaborn <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seaborn>`
- Annotated posterior draws of parameter estimates, as `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>` dataframes
- Supports caching via as `stancache <http://github.com/jburos/stancache>` or `pystan-cache <https://github.com/paulkernfeld/pystan-cache>`
